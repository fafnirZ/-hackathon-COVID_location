# -hackathon-COVID_location

This is the COVID summariser we have created for a hackathon, which fetches periodically (per day) the latest official NSW dataset of 
new coronavirus cases, and removes all unnecessary data that confuses the general public. Leaving only the most crucial data for the 
average joe; the amount of new cases and the suburb in which these cases arise from

There is also an option to subscribe to a optional push notification type service, where you get a phone text whenever new cases in your
suburb is found
